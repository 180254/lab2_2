# lab2_2
Two branches note:<br>
I was working on branch "master"<br>
<b>but</b> i made a mistake in git configuration<br>
and there is a end of line comversion issue in commits.<br>

I manually "recommit" changes from branch "master" to branch "<b>fixCRLF</b>".<br>
In branch "fixCRLF" there is no issue anymore, but commit time are "not real".<br>
